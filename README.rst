Slack Pycon 2019 Workshop
=============================

**This repo is to complement the live demonstration being given at Pycon 2019.**

In this workshop, we discuss how we develop and maintain our open-source Python tools at Slack. Weâ€™ll also teach you how to build your own useful Slack bot and leave plenty of time for Q&A.

Beginners are welcome! Developers with Slack experience will learn about recently released features and tools and have face time with the Dev Rel team.

This example app shows how easy it is to implement the Slack Events API Adapter to receive Slack Events and respond to messages using Slack's Web API via our python slackclient.
